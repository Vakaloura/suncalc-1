## Internals
This library was automatically build using [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) to target {{ target_env_name }}.

Refer to {{ meta.url }} when you want to contribute. Note that you should only report issues against [this repository]({{ meta.target_info[kv.target].repo_url }}) when you think the issue only occurs in the {{ target_env_name }} port of this library. If you are unsure, report [against the source repository]({{ meta.url }}) instead.
